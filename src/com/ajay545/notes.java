        Declaring (Creating) Variables


            To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

            EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES THAT WE HAVE IN JAVA:

                String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
                int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
                float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
                char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
                boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

                    type variable = value;

                   String name = "John";
                   System.out.println(name);


                   int myNum = 15;
                   System.out.println(myNum);



Final Variables

You can add the final keyword if you don't want to overwrite existing values OF A VARIABLE
